Version: 0.3
Author: Sacha Epskamp

Description: Estimate, fit and compare Structural Equation Models (SEM) and network models (Gaussian Graphical Models; GGM) using OpenMx. Allows for two possible generalizations to include GGMs in SEM: GGMs can be used between latent variables (latent network modeling; LNM) or between residuals (residual network modeling; RNM).
